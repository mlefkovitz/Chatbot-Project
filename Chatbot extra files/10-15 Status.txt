Implemented an AI agent that uses Case Based Reasoning as described in: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4f6e/b7a11467c4e90936703142e5c4fdf9031d9d.pdf

When testing against the 109FAQ questions:
Score 78.2
81 correct = 74.3%

Of the 28 incorrect:
23 of the responses are "This course has 26 videos with about 18 hours of instruction." This is the answer to two questions that contain the word "How"
4 of the responses are "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByL9Kt_U_JJuQmZxSEtnWENiUXc" This is the answer to 6 questions that contain the words "Where", "Can", "I", and "find"
1 response is "The professor for this class". The two professor questions have three overlap words "Who", "is", and "professor". The differentiating words are "this", "class", and "Goel".
