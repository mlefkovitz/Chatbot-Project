Do I need to know computer vision?The projects do not require any specialized knowledge of computer vision or image processing.
Are projects individual or group?Projects will be done individually.
What are the primary learning goals for KBAI?The primary learning goals are: First, this class teaches the concepts, methods, and prominent issues in knowledge-based artificial intelligence. Second, it teaches the specific skills and abilities needed to apply those concepts to the design of knowledge-based AI agents. Third, it teaches the relationship between knowledge-based artificial intelligence and the study of human cognition.
What is the structure of this course?The structure of this course is driven by several pedagogical motivations: learning by example, learning by doing, project-based learning, personalization, collaborative learning, peer-to-peer learning, self-reflection and authenticity.
What will I learn in this class?At the conclusion of this class: first you will have learned to be able to design and implement a knowledge-based artificial intelligence agent that can address a complex task using the methods discussed in the course. Second, you will be able to use this agent to reflect on the process of human cognition. Third, you will be able to use both these practices to address practical problems in multiple domains.
What is the Technical Report?The Technical Report is a document that provides more detailed accounts of learning goals, strategies, and outcomes of this course.
How is this class taught?Each topic is taught through examples of the way in which humans and artificial intelligence agents approach certain problems, often building from human thought toward AI agents and subsequently referring back to human cognition.
How does this course encourage Learning by Doing?Students will participate in the reasoning within each particular lesson, and subsequently tie the topic back to a broader problem.
How does this course utilize Project Based Learning strategies?This class has three projects, each of which build on the previous one, and the overall goals and motivations of KBAI are presented through these projects.
Is Collaborative Learning allowed?We encourage collaboration and the development of communities of practice surrounding the course material and projects. We are excited to see students borrow one another’s ideas and build on them, as well as spin off on their own study groups.
How does Peer-to-Peer Learning work?During this class, students will give their peers feedback on their work for completed assignments. This lets students see additional approaches to the problems, provides extra feedback, and puts students in the position of a teacher, which has been shown to be a pedagogically useful role reversal.
How does this course encourage Self-Reflection?At the conclusion of each lesson, each student is asked to reflect on what they learned in the class. Each design project requires the writing of a project reflection that explains and critiques, and reflects on the student’s work on the project.
How does this course ensure Authenticity?The project that is explored in this class is an open research question in the AI and Cognitive Systems research communities. Two students from our lab have completed dissertations working on these questions in the past two years, and we have had papers published on these topics within the past several months.
How many projects does this course have?This class has three projects.
Where can I find more information on learning goals, strategies, and outcomes?More information can be found in the Technical Report.
Can I watch lectures in advance?Students are welcome and encouraged to proceed at their own pace throughout the lessons, including viewing them outside of the designed order to better align with their interests.
Can I discuss completed assignments with other students?Absolutely! Students will give and receive peer feedback for completed assignments. We encourage a collaborative learning environment.

What components will determine final grades?Your final grade will be determined by 3 written assignments worth 12%, 3 programming assignments worth 45%, 2 unproctored exams worth 35% and 24 peer feedback activities worth 8%.
When can we expect to receive grades after a submission?2 weeks after the original submission
Do the grades assigned to me by peers affect my grade?No. The primary purpose of supplying the graders with the results of the peer feedback process is to help the graders ensure every student gets useful feedback, as well as to ensure that the peer feedback received is accurate.
How will grades be released?Grades will generally be released via both T-Square and Peer Feedback. Written feedback from the graders, however, will only be released via Peer Feedback. For Projects, sub-scores for your agent's performance on the problems and for your project reflection will be returned via the assignment submission page, and the overall project score will be posted to the grade book. Check marks for Peer Feedback participation will be provided throughout the semester via the assignment submission pages for those tasks, and a final Peer Feedback score (based both on completion and quality of participation) will be assigned at the end of the semester.
Are there fixed thresholds for grades?No.
Will there be curving of grade?Yes
What have the grade statistics for this class been in the past?For the Fall 2015 KBAI class, the average was in the low 80's, and only about 10% of the class ended with a raw score over 90; well over half the class still received an A, though
What are the individual weights of the 2 unproctored exams?15% for mid-term exam and 20% for final exam
What should I do to get good grades on this class?We encourage you to focus first on doing the best you can on all assignments; if you do, your grade should take care of itself.
How many assignments are in the class?There will be 3 assignments in the course.
What is the word limit for each assignment?Each assignment should be approximately 1,000 words (neither a minimum nor a maximum, just a heuristic)
What topics do the assignments cover?Each assignment relates to a certain topic or set of topics in the course material to some problem. For Assignments 1 the problem should be the class project. For Assignments 2, we will provide a list of problems that you can choose from. For Assignments 3, you may choose from that same list, or you may select a problem of your own.
What advantages does peer-to-peer feedback provide me?Peer-to-peer feedback provides a number of opportunities: it gives you the opportunity to see your classmates' work, it gets you more feedback on your work than you would otherwise receive, and it puts you in the position of critiquing and analyzing course material.
How do I participate in peer-to-peer feedback?We will use a tool called Peer Feedback -- peerfeedback.gatech.edu -- to give peer-to-peer feedback in this class.

How does peer-to-peer feedback impact our grade on the assignment?Peers will evaluate one another on the same rubric that graders will use; however, the scores you assign to your peers will not factor into their actual grades on the assignment.
Do the TAs look at the feedback?TAs will see the feedback you give to your peers in order to ensure that all students receive adequate feedback.
How much of my grade depends on completing peer feedback?Completing peer feedback exercises is 8% of your average.
Does the quality of feedback I provide matter?Your peer feedback average will be determined not only based on whether or not you completed all assigned peer feedback exercises, but also based on the quality of the feedback you provided as evaluated by the TAs and by the recipients of the feedback.

What kind of conflict am I liable for?Conflicts such as weddings, business trips, and conference, you should complete your work in advance. That is why all of the assignments and project resources are provided to you at the start of the semester.
Is this course the same as the previous semesters?No. every semester is a learning experience. Each subsequent semesters benefit from the lessons learned the previous semesters.
Can I provide the teaching staff feedback on how I think that the course is going?Absolutely! In fact, we encourage students to provide feedback on things that work, and things that could be done better.
How can I provide feedback?You may take advantage of the feedback box on Piazza, as well as the surveys we will send out over the course of the semester.
